      <p>
        Zero is an AI-powered email client that manages your inbox, so you don't have to. We help busy professionals unclutter their inboxes, prioritize important messages, summarize conversations, complete tasks, and even chat with their inbox — letting them spend less time managing email and more time getting things done.
      </p>

  {
    title: 'Why We Started',
    content: (
      <p>
        We started Zero because we were frustrated that email — the most-used communication tool in the world — hasn't meaningfully evolved in decades. Despite countless new apps, none actually solve the real problem: helping you finish what you intend to do. We realized the real solution isn't just a new interface — it's AI acting like a true assistant inside your inbox.

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          Zero is built on the principles of transparency and community collaboration. Our entire codebase is open source, allowing anyone to:
        </p>
        <ul className="ml-4 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>Review our code for security and privacy</li>
          <li>Contribute improvements and new features</li>
          <li>Self-host their own instance of Zero</li>
          <li>Learn from and build upon our work</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We believe that email is too important to be controlled by a single entity. By being open source, we ensure that Zero remains transparent, trustworthy, and accessible to everyone.

      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          We launched our early access program and have already seen strong demand, with over 15,000 signups in just under 3 months. What we found is that users want an assistant that streamlines their inbox, providing features to summarize emails, compose responses, and take necessary actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opportunity is massive: over 4 billion people use email daily, and most still manage it manually. Zero is poised to fundamentally change the way the world deals with communication and tasks — and we're just getting started.

          Adam and Nizar, the cofounders of Zero, met through family friends. Coming from backgrounds in product design and software engineering, we both felt the pain of drowning in email firsthand while trying to build and grow companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're driven by a shared belief that email should help you move faster, not slow you down.
